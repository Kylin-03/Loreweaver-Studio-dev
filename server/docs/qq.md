# Play in a QQ group

The terminal client can sit in a QQ group as an ordinary **protocol client** —
`loreweaver bridge --config <file>`. It dials the same Iroh ticket any other
client would, joins as room members, and renders the table to text. It is **not**
an engine adapter: `adapters/` stays the local CLI, and the five chat-platform
adapters stay retired.

The bot **is** the Keeper (the AI). The person listed as an admin holds a
keeper-role key: they configure the table and they are also a player at it.

## What you run

On the host machine, two processes:

1. A OneBot 11 implementation — [NapCat](https://github.com/NapNeko/NapCatQQ) is
   the one this was written and probed against; [LLOneBot](https://github.com/LLOneBot/LLOneBot)
   speaks the same wire. Lagrange's main branch now ships the Milky protocol, not
   OneBot 11 (its OneBot 11 build lives only on the sunset `v1` branch), so do not
   point this bridge at a current Lagrange.
2. The terminal client in bridge mode:

```bash
loreweaver bridge --config bridge.json
```

If `bridge.json` has no `ticket`, the bridge calls the same one-click host as
the TUI ("Host locally & play") and takes the ticket and keeper key it returns.
Studio and TUI users can still join that room with ordinary invites — the bridge
is one more member set, not a different room.

## Config

One JSON file per bridge process. Timeouts are **seconds** (the old OneBot
adapter's unit); the client converts them to milliseconds internally.

```json
{
  "ticket": "endpoint…",
  "keeper_key": "…",
  "locale": "zh",
  "onebot": {
    "mode": "forward",
    "ws_url": "ws://127.0.0.1:3001",
    "access_token": "replace-with-a-long-random-token",
    "request_timeout": 10,
    "reconnect_delay": 1
  },
  "groups": [
    {
      "group_id": 123456789,
      "room_keeper_key": "…",
      "admins": [11111111],
      "mode": "mention"
    }
  ],
  "busy_notice": true,
  "idle_close_minutes": 30,
  "state_dir": "~/.loreweaver/bridge"
}
```

Omit `ticket` (and `keeper_key`) to host locally. One group maps to one room; a
keeper key is room-bound, so each group names its room's key. Two groups must
not share a `room_keeper_key` (or the top-level `keeper_key`). The top-level
`keeper_key` is the default for a single-group setup. `locale` is optional: when
unset, the bridge follows the room's `welcome.locale`. `idle_close_minutes: 0`
disables idle-close of player links (the observer and control links never idle-close).

State files (`<group>.keyring.json`, `<group>.posted.json`,
`<group>.settings.json`) are written mode 0600 under `state_dir`.

## Forward vs reverse

OneBot uses one universal WebSocket for events and actions. Pick exactly one
mode.

**Forward** (typical for NapCat on the same machine): the bridge connects out to
the implementation and reconnects after a drop. Set `onebot.mode` to `forward`
and `ws_url` to a `ws://` or `wss://` URL.

`access_token` is **required in both modes** and is sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. NapCat instances left with an empty token were
mass-exploited in 2026 and the QQ accounts behind them banned; use a long random
token and paste the same value into the implementation's `token` field. In
forward mode the bridge calls `get_login_info` at startup and logs the QQ id it
is logged in as; a wrong token fails startup with a clear error, because NapCat
and LLOneBot reject the token *after* the WebSocket upgrade and an open socket
alone proves nothing. The same check runs again after every reconnect.

**Reverse**: the implementation connects in. Set `listen_host` / `listen_port` /
`path` (default `/onebot/v11/ws`). A client that sends `X-Client-Role` must use
`Universal`. Keep the listener on loopback unless you have secured the
surrounding network. The bridge reads the token only from the
`Authorization: Bearer` header, which is what NapCat and LLOneBot send from their
`token` field — a token pasted into the URL as `?access_token=` is refused. A
refused handshake answers with an `onebot.reverse.rejected.*` code in the body
and one log line: `token_in_query` (move the token into the implementation's
token field), `missing_authorization`, `wrong_token`, `path`, or `role`. The
implementation's own log only ever says "Expected 101 status code". In reverse
mode startup succeeds as soon as the listener is up, before any implementation
has dialed in; the `get_login_info` check runs on each accepted connection, and
a wrong token on the implementation's side shows up only as that refused
handshake.

NapCat / LLOneBot: enable the OneBot 11 websocket, paste the same token, and
point the URL (forward) or the reverse host/port (reverse) at this process.

## Admins

Admins are QQ ids in the group's `admins` list. They can also be added and
removed at runtime with `.bridge admin add|remove <qq>` (admin-only, handled by
the bridge, never forwarded to the engine). The runtime list is saved in
`<group>.settings.json` and from then on outranks the config file, so the bridge
refuses to remove the last admin: add another one first. Adding or removing an admin
changes the role of that person's existing key (`admin_update_key`) — their seat, and
the character they claimed, stay theirs; the new role applies from their next message.

Every keeper-gated engine command already works over a keeper-role link: import,
`.skill`, `.panels`, `.pack install`, `.model`, `.save`, `.reset`, `.module`,
`.rule`, `.preset`, `.phase`, `.var expose`, `.dev mount`, `.language`,
`.chronicle`, `.lore`, `.imagegen`, `.forge`.

Where a command's reply lands is the engine's call, the same one every client
sees. A reply the engine **broadcasts to the table** (the `.pack install`
receipt, `.st show`, a `.pc claim`) is posted in the group — and, when you typed
the command in private chat, you get it there too. A reply the engine sends to
**you alone** (`.help`, `.lore`, `.var`, `.model`, and any command that failed)
always goes to your private chat, for players as well as admins, even when the
command was typed in the group; it is never posted in the group. The bot never
repeats your command back to you. A private reply carries the
group it came from, so NapCat delivers it over the **group temp session** when
the admin and the bot are not friends (the group must allow members to start
temp chats) and over the ordinary friend chat when they are. Before adding the
group, the bridge confirms NapCat can resolve that member; when it cannot, the
reply goes out as a plain private message instead, because NapCat would
otherwise fall back to posting into the group. If the private send still fails,
the group is told only to add the bot as a friend; the content is never posted
in the group. The bot never answers friend requests itself (`request` events are
ignored), so approve a friend request in the QQ client that is logged into the
bot account.

Secret-reading commands (`.lore`, `.var`, anything that would show keeper-only
material) should be sent as a **private message** to the bot. The admin doc is
the same instruction: private chat is where those answers go, and it is also
where you should ask.

A player-addressed `system` / `error` notice ("your input is queued") is
answered on the channel that input was typed on: private stays private even
if the same person then types in the group. `.imagegen` and `.forge` are
ordinary engine commands in this release; the bridge needs nothing extra for
them.

Bridge-level commands (admin-only): `.bridge status`, `.bridge members`,
`.bridge kick <qq>`, `.bridge admin add|remove <qq>`, `.bridge mode all|mention`,
`.bridge notice on|off`.

Group default is `mention` mode: recognized commands (`.`, `/`, `r `, the zh
dialect) always forward; story prose forwards only when the bot is @-mentioned,
unless the table sets `.bridge mode all`. Replying to one of the Keeper's
messages in QQ inserts an @ by itself; a reply whose @ was deleted is, on
purpose, not for the Keeper and is left alone.

## Players and names

A player's key is minted on their first message and **named after their group
card** (nickname when there is no card; `qq:<id>` when the event carries
neither). That name is what the Keeper sees and uses; once a player claims a
character, the Keeper attributes their lines as `<character> (<card>)`. The name
is fixed at first sight: changing a group card later does not rename the seat.
The name is cleaned (control characters out, whitespace collapsed) and cut to
32 characters; a card that would copy another seat's name, or looks like the
`qq:` fallback, falls back to `qq:<id>`. Two players with the same card are
still two seats.

Long Keeper output — anything over one QQ message — arrives as **one
merged-forward card** (one node per chunk, signed as the bot), not as a wall of
consecutive messages. A card cannot quote or @: a long answer to a player's
command does not quote their message.

## The one gap

**Tier-2 HTML panels cannot render in a chat group.** That is the one
structural gap. `.panel <id>` prints the text form, which is what the group
gets. Meters, badges, choices, letters, clippings and the rest of the `ui`
blocks degrade to lines of text. Audio is a title line only.

## Turns take a few minutes

A player turn is not a chat reply. The Keeper may roll, read sheets, write
trackers, speak as NPCs, and wait on companion sub-turns. Worst case that is
on the order of **five minutes**, not five seconds. When `busy_notice` is on
(the default), the group gets one "the Keeper is thinking" line at the start
of a turn. That is the heartbeat. Do not assume the bot is stuck because the
group is quiet.

## What the log tells you

- `OneBot is not up yet …` — nothing answered the forward URL at startup. NapCat
  opens its port only after the QQ login, so a bridge started first (a host reboot, a
  QR re-login) waits and starts the moment it answers; printed once. A rejected token
  still fails at once.
- `OneBot is up: logged in as QQ …` — the token was accepted and this is the
  account that answered; printed at startup and again after every reconnect.
- `OneBot connection dropped; reconnecting.` / `OneBot connection is offline.` —
  the socket dropped; at most one line per kind per minute during a redial storm.
- The token / self-check error lines can also appear after startup: a reconnect
  or a reverse-mode accept whose `get_login_info` fails prints the same message
  startup would have, once per minute.
- A `reconnecting` line with nothing else wrong usually means the heartbeat
  watchdog fired: the implementation announces a heartbeat interval, and when
  no frame at all arrives for 2.5× that interval the socket is treated as
  half-open (router timeout, host asleep) and redialed. With heartbeats
  disabled on the implementation the watchdog never arms.
- `Attachment … was not forwarded (reason)` — a player's image could not be
  fetched (no direct URL, an expired signed link, size, an unsafe address, or the
  room's media policy). The text still went through. The reason is a machine
  code; the URL is never logged because NapCat's links carry a signed key.

## Signals

`SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` close every Iroh link (including the control links used
only to mint and delete keys), close the OneBot socket or reverse listener, and
flush the state files.
