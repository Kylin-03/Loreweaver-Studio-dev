"""Installing a `.lwpack` into THIS server's data dir, and the trust card that describes it.

Two callers, one implementation: the operator's `python -m app --install <ref>` and the
keeper's in-room `.pack install <ref>`. The CLI owns the interactive confirmation and the
printing; everything below the confirmation — which directories a pack lands in, which
engine versions it is checked against, and clearing the discovery caches afterwards — is
the same work, and a second copy of it is how the two doors drift apart.

`trust_card_lines` renders the disclosure card as LINES rather than printing them, so the
same card reaches a terminal (stderr) and a room (one reply). Disclosure, not a gate —
the same trust stance as full EJS: the operator's box, the operator's call.
