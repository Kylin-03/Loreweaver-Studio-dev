"""Dev rooms — mount a pack SOURCE dir into a room and reload it on save (H2 Bomb-1
author DX). Kills the edit → pack → install → reimport minute-loop: the author edits
files, the room follows.

The moving parts, and where each lives:

- **Confinement.** `.dev mount <path>` reads server-side files, so mounts only resolve
  under `settings.dev.source_root` (`TRPG_DEV__SOURCE_ROOT`); with the root unset the
  whole surface is off. This is deliberate networked-admin posture, not paranoia — a
  remote keeper must not be able to point the server's parsers at arbitrary paths.
- **Discovery.** A mount registers three ways at once: as a virtual pack home
  (`gateway.panels.set_dev_pack_homes` — panels, presentation kits and pack-relative
  assets read straight from source), and as extra skill/rulepack discovery dirs
  (`core.skills` / `core.rulepacks` — a save is one cache-clear away from live).
- **Reload.** Re-reads the source manifest, REMOVES the lore this mount previously
  wrote (`core.worldbook.add` dedupes by id, so without the removal an edited entry
  would keep its stale text forever), then re-imports: world-detected cards through
  the real `.import … world` path (hooks/modvars/pregens/brief all replace by
  construction; InitVar merge and modvar redefinition keep the room's live values),
  lorebooks through the real `.lore import` path, then a skills/rulepacks cache clear
  and a panels/state push. A manifest that no longer parses reports and changes
  NOTHING.
- **The watcher.** One asyncio task per mounted room polls the tree's mtimes (no new
  dependency; the repo has no file-watching precedent to reuse). It is the only
  caller that takes `hub.turn_lock` itself — the `.dev` command paths are already
  inside the transport choke points' lock (defensive-patterns #1) and must not
  re-acquire. Each cycle re-checks the persisted mount record, so a `.reset all`,
  room import or restore that cleared it stops the watcher instead of it re-seeding
  a fresh room. After a server restart the record survives but the task does not;
  any `.dev` command re-arms it (documented, deliberate v1).
