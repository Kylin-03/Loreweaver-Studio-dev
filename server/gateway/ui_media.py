"""The reachability gate for content-addressed ``ui`` blocks (M19).

``core.hooks`` validates the SHAPE of a hash-bearing block (``image``, ``map_pin``) —
64 hex chars, capped caption — but a shape check cannot know whether this room may
fetch that blob.
The media byte channel already answers ``{op:"get", hash}`` only for the caller's
own room media plus assets of packs ENABLED in that room; an ``image`` block
pointing anywhere else would render as a permanent broken picture (and would be
a probe for what other rooms hold). So every emitted image hash is resolved here,
against exactly those two sources, before the frame reaches the wire:

- room media (``infra.media_store``) — uploads, KP-generated handouts, Director art;
- enabled-pack assets (``gateway.panels``) — the module's own shipped pictures.

An unresolvable hash drops its block; a frame left with no blocks drops entirely.
The resolved MIME is stamped onto the block so clients never have to guess, and a
hash that resolves to something that is not a picture drops too (an ``image``
block aimed at an mp3 is an authoring error, not a render).
