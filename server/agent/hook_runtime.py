"""Room-level loading and effect application for the event-hook layer (`core.hooks`).

`load_room_hook_engine` collects a room's registered hook scripts — every enabled skill's
`hooks.js` plus any card-installed scripts under the room_state ``room_hooks`` row — and builds one
sandboxed `HookEngine` per turn over the room's variable snapshots (KEEPER view: hooks are
module logic, the same trust tier as the Keeper prompt; what they choose to `narrate()` is
authorial output, exactly like lore text).

`apply_hook_writes` is the deterministic half of the contract: buffered `setvar` writes route
through validation — a name matching a declared module variable goes through
`core.modvars.set_modvar` (kind/bounds enforced), anything else lands in the MVU tree
via `core.mvu_compat.apply_set`. A failing write is skipped and reported, never fatal.
