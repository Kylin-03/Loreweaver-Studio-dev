"""Consumption-time rendering of SillyTavern-card-derived prose for sub-actor prompts.

Imported card fields (description/personality -> ``NpcRecord.persona``, tags -> ``playstyle``,
...) routinely contain EJS templates and ``{{user}}``/``{{char}}`` macros written for the
ST-Prompt-Template extension. The stored record keeps the RAW authored text (so it always
evaluates against the CURRENT room variables); this module renders it at the moment an actor
prompt is assembled (`agent.npc_actor` / `agent.companion_actor`), never at import time.

RED LINE (iron rule #3 -- information isolation): everything rendered here resolves through the
PLAYER PROJECTION of BOTH room variable documents -- `modvars` (keeper-only trackers dropped)
AND the imported `mvu_tree` (only leaves under a keeper-exposed prefix survive, fail-closed:
nothing exposed -> nothing rendered, the card-split (拆卡) doctrine's `.var expose` gate). The
full-EJS engine -- when ``settings.enable_full_ejs`` is on -- is fed ONLY those two projected
views and an EMPTY worldinfo map; note it hands templates the tree RAW as
``stat_data``/``variables``, so projecting the tree BEFORE it is handed over is the only thing
standing between an un-exposed leaf and a ``<%- JSON.stringify(stat_data) %>``. An
NPC/companion actor must never observe
keeper-only variables or the room worldbook through a card template; a template branch that
reads one behaves exactly as if it were unset.

Rendering here is READ-ONLY: template ``setvar()``/``incvar()`` writes are deliberately
DISCARDED (subset path: ``setter=None`` so statements no-op; full engine: ``pending_writes``
is never read back). Only the main Keeper prompt lane (`agent.prompt_builder`) flushes
template writes to the store -- an actor voicing a line must not mutate room state.

FAIL-SAFE: raw ``<% %>`` syntax never reaches the LLM. The full engine (built lazily, AT MOST
ONCE per renderer, i.e. per actor turn) degrades to the `core.ejs_lite` subset on any error,
and the subset itself degrades to tag-stripped plain text -- never to raw template syntax.
