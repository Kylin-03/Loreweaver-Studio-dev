"""AI-KP tools for deterministic relationship tracks (好感/情欲) between named entities.

`RelationshipTools` is the function-calling surface over `core.relationships.RelationshipManager`:
directional numeric tracks (affection/desire) between any two named entities (PCs, NPCs,
companions) that the KP nudges with `adjust_relationship`/`set_relationship` after a meaningful
beat, and reads back on demand with `get_relationships`. Per iron rule #1 (deterministic vs
generative split), the VALUES themselves are real code -- clamped and persisted here -- the model
only narrates around them; `agent.prompt_builder` separately folds the CURRENT state into the main
KP prompt every turn (the always-on path), so `get_relationships` is only the read-on-demand path.

All three tools are `gated=True` (Layer B.2 -- see `agent.tools.tool` and `docs/plugins.md` "Layer
B"): hidden from the model's toolset and refused on dispatch until a room enables a skill whose
`allowed-tools` names them (e.g. `skills/romance-relationships`). None are `keeper_only` -- these
tracks are not secret keeper material, they're mechanical state like a character sheet. All
user-visible text is looked up via `services.i18n` under `relationships.tools.*`
(`locales/{en,zh}/relationships.json`).
