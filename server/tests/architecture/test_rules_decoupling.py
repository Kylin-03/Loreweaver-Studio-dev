"""M16 architecture gate: the agent layer decouples COMPLETELY from rule systems.

`agent/` talks to rules exclusively through the neutral `core.check_outcome`
contract, the compiled rulepack layer, and the engine registries. It must not
import a system rules module, name a system, or compare a rank id string —
semantic flags (`success`/`critical`/`fumble`) and `tier` only.

The allowlist below records the files that are still coupled TODAY, each tagged
with the M16 stage that clears it. It must only ever SHRINK: a file that goes
clean fails the test until its entry is removed, and by the end of M16 the
allowlist is EMPTY.
