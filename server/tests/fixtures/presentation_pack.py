"""A real installed-and-enabled pack carrying a presentation kit (M19).

The Stage Director is kit-gated by design — a module opts into having one by shipping
`ui/presentation.yaml` — so anything that exercises it needs a genuine pack on disk,
installed and enabled for the room. This builds the smallest one that still covers the
kit's whole surface (a subject WITH a 定妆 reference, a subject WITHOUT one, an audio
cue) through the real build/install path, so the tests also prove the pack pipeline
carries kits end to end.
