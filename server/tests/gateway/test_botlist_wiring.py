"""`GatewayRunner`'s anti-bot-loop pre-LLM gate must actually engage.

Regression: `gateway.ops.Botlist.add` had no production caller anywhere in the
codebase, so `GatewayRunner.botlist` was permanently empty and `.is_bot` never
returned True for anything an admin tried to block -- the "known bot ids"
half of the anti-loop guard (`docs/specs/M2.md` §7) never actually engaged.

This proves both halves of the gate that now cover it end-to-end:
1. `SessionSource.is_bot` (a platform's own author-is-a-bot flag, e.g. Discord,
   Telegram, or Feishu) short-circuits on its own.
2. `gateway.commands.CommandRouter.cmd_botlist` (the `.botlist add` command)
   populates the SAME `Botlist` instance `on_inbound` consults, which now
   catches platforms without a reliable native bot flag (including QQ and OneBot)
   and provides a manual override for any platform.
