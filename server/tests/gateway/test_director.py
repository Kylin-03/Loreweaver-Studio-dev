"""Tests for M10 companion auto-pacing wiring (BUG D fix).

`docs/specs/M10-companions.md` §4 locks companion pacing to on-request (exploration) + auto on
initiative (combat). `gateway.director.run_director` is the auto half; `gateway.turn.run_turn`
calls it after every REAL (non-command) AI-KP turn. Before this fix, nothing in the turn path ever
called it, so a party's AI companions never acted on their own -- even with `.party auto` on and an
active initiative order. These tests pin:

- a real player turn auto-triggers a companion's turn when `.party auto` is on AND the room is in
  combat (an active initiative order) -- WITHOUT the KP ever calling `companion_act` itself;
- it does NOT trigger with auto off, or outside combat (no initiative order);
- a command turn never reaches the director at all;
- the structural anti-runaway: a companion's own turn (`ctx.platform == "companion"`) never
  re-triggers the director, even given `run_director` directly.
