"""M17 oracle: the five red-line secrecy sentinels, ported to the document layer.

Secrecy fails SILENTLY — it leaks without erroring — so these projection tests
were written FIRST (red against the trivial stub projection) and the store
conversion only started once each type's real projection turned them green.

Each test constructs a document carrying a sentinel secret and asserts the
sentinel never crosses `project()` toward a player-grade viewer, with positive
controls proving the projection still carries what it must (a filter that
returns nothing would pass a leak assertion vacuously).

The five mechanisms, same sentinels as the pre-M17 red-line tests:
1. worldbook secret entries          — KEEPER_SECRET_SENTINEL
2. NPC actor isolation               — THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER IS THE MURDERER / Elias Crane
3. MVU fail-closed wire filter       — the 真凶 subtree
4. knowledge-pool split              — THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER IS THE MURDERER
5. modvar keeper-visibility          — the true_culprit tracker
