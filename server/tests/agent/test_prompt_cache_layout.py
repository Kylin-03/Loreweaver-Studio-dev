"""ORACLE: the cacheable prefix really is stable, turn over turn.

The 1.x section order opened with session history and game state — the two things
that change every turn — so every turn invalidated the whole downstream prefix and
the module pool, the rulepack expertise, the style layer and the skill bodies were
re-read at full price. A 2026-08-07 long session burned 40% of a weekly quota partly
this way. P1 (2026-08-07) fixed the ORDER inside the system prompt; M20 A1/A2 fixed
the two things that made the fix stop at the system message:

- the volatile tail sat INSIDE the system message, so everything after it — all of
  the replayed history — was recomputed every turn anyway. It now rides a `state`
  message just before the player's, and the wire layout is
  ``[system: stable] [history] [state: volatile] [user]`` with breakpoints at the end
  of the system message and the end of history.
- the 20-message sliding window dropped its front message once at the cap, so no
  downstream prefix could be stable either. History is now append-only between folds.

Two acceptance tests carry this, and they test different things:

- ``test_the_stable_head_is_stable_in_fact`` — the SECTION ROUTING is honest (nothing
  that varies per turn hides in the head). Structural; needs no model.
- ``test_the_cached_prefix_survives_the_next_turn`` — the LAYOUT delivers, measured on
  what the loop actually put on the wire across two consecutive real turns. This is
  the only test here that can prove the milestone paid for itself; if it fails, the
  stage did not land, whatever the section-order tests say.
