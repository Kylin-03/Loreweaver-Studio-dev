"""Sentinel tests for the AI-NPC sub-actor's PRIVATE `action_intent` channel (audit S05).

`speak_as_npc` EMITS its line (`AgentCtx.emit_npc_line`) and `gateway.turn._npc_events`
publishes that line as an `npc` narrative frame to every member of the room; the tool's
return value carries the same performed line, so BOTH are player-grade surfaces, not
keeper-side ones. The sub-actor's `action_intent` (what the
NPC privately means to DO next, e.g. slip out the back door to warn the cult) must never
ride it, in any locale.

The session report is NOT a keeper-side surface either: `.report` is a
`required_level=0`, room-broadcast command (`gateway.commands.world.cmd_report`), so parking
the intent anywhere it renders would only delay the same leak.

Sentinel shape: the intent text is the secret that must not cross the boundary, and every
assertion is paired with a POSITIVE CONTROL (the dialogue/mood that SHOULD cross, and the
keeper surface that SHOULD receive the intent) so no test can pass vacuously on an empty
or failed line.
