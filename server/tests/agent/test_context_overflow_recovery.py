"""M23 WS2: a provider that refuses the prompt as too long no longer kills the turn.

The usage meter has lied three times, and each time a long campaign hit a wall the
meter could not see: the turn was discarded, usage recorded zero, so the meter did not
move and the next turn hit the same wall. The provider's own refusal is the one reading
that cannot be stale — so it becomes the fold's second trigger.

Everything here is offline. The overflow is injected by a `FakeLLM` responder raising
an error built from the body OpenAI's own documentation prints (see
`tests/infra/test_llm_errors.py` for the per-vendor shapes).
