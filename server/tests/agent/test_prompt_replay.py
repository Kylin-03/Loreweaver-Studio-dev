"""M23 WS3 acceptance: the same persisted room state re-assembles the same prompt.

`tests/architecture/test_prompt_replayability.py` proves no NEW unreplayable input can
be added. This proves the two that existed are gone: a second process, reading nothing
but the store, rebuilds a prompt byte-identical to the one the model saw — including the
segments that used to come from an unseeded generator and from process memory.

The room is built to exercise exactly those two: a worldbook entry gated on
`probability` (a real-code coin flip that decides whether a segment appears at all), an
entry whose body contains a `{{random}}` macro (a real-code choice inside a segment), and
a hook injection (a segment handed over on `ctx.extra` and nowhere else).
