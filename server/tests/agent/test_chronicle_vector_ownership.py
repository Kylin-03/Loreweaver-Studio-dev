"""F12 regression: a folded chronicle's vector point is room-owned like any other.

`agent.chronicle` indexes folded records with the worldbook payload scheme
(`collection` + `namespace`), so `net.room_backup.room_vector_points` selects
them through its `{"namespace": chat_key}` query. Before the fix the ownership
predicate recognised exactly ONE namespace-scoped collection by name
("worldbook") and fell through to the chat-key branch for every other, so a
chronicle point read as ambiguously owned and every room-wide vector path
raised `ValueError("vector point has conflicting room ownership")` once a room
had folded even once: export, backup snapshot/restore, room delete, `.reset all`.

Every test here folds for real (FakeLLM + FakeEmbeddings, offline) and asserts
the indexed point exists BEFORE exercising a backup path, so none of them can
pass vacuously by silently indexing nothing. The last two are the positive
controls: a point that genuinely names two rooms still fails closed, and a point
missing its lane's own scope field is still not treated as room-owned.
