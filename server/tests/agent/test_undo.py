"""ORACLE for M20 D: a rewind that moves BOTH halves of the room, or neither.

The first draft of this design asserted a necessary condition as a sufficient one:
"history is append-only, so rewinding is a pointer move". True, and not enough. A turn's
tool calls also write documents (NPC records, modvars, sheets) and room_state (clock,
scene, relationship tracks). Rewinding only the conversation produces the worst kind of
inconsistency — both halves self-consistent, the whole a hallucination — and that is the
thing most of this file is about.

The depth cap is the other load-bearing decision, and it is not a size compromise: capping
inside the chronicle's no-future lag window makes a conflict with the rolling summary
STRUCTURALLY impossible, because those turns have not been folded yet. So the cap derives
from the setting, and the test that matters most here is the one that moves the setting.
