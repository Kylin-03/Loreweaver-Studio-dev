"""M18 oracle: the chronicle fold flow (`agent.chronicle`) — hysteresis, no-future, retention.

Written FIRST (red), offline and deterministic (FakeLLM/FakeEmbeddings). The
suite-wide conftest disables the chronicle fold (its LLM call would make every
other FakeLLM call-count assertion nondeterministic); these tests opt back in
on their own services, mirroring `tests/agent/test_scribe.py`.

The four oracles from the M18 brief:
1. spoiler projections      — tests/documents/test_chronicle_projections.py
2. no-future guard          — the lag window is never folded; forged fold input
                              referencing turns beyond the watermark is rejected
3. fold hysteresis          — 0.60 triggers, batches fold to the 0.40 floor,
                              0.85 is the emergency level (before the model call)
4. motivation regression    — after a 108-turn synthetic campaign under token
                              pressure, the session-3 pivotal choice is still
                              answerable at session 12 via retrieval or summary
