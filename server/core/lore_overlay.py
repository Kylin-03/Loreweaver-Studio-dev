"""M26 — the lore overlay: the room admin's switch over imported lore, as a separate document.

An imported lorebook is stored FAITHFULLY: a file that says `enabled: false` stays
`enabled: false` in the room's `lore` documents forever, because re-importing a revised
card has to be a clean replace rather than a merge with somebody's edits. That left the
human at the table with no lever at all — the only way to flip an entry on was to ask the
AI Keeper to rewrite the stored copy (`update_lore`), which is both a model turn and a
destructive edit of the author's file.

This module is the missing layer, and it is modelled on the one the engine already has for
imported VARIABLES (`core.mvu_compat`'s exposure list): a per-room, KEEPER-ONLY document
that says, per entry TITLE, what the effective `enabled` and `condition` are. The stored
entry is never touched, so:

- faithful import survives (the file's own flags are still there to re-read);
- a re-import replaces the lore and leaves the overlay alone, the same promise the
  variable tree already makes ("re-import never resets progress");
- a pack that ADOPTS a foreign card can ship the annotations as data (`§ the overlay
  file` below) without the engine learning one card's vocabulary.

Keyed by title, not id: ids regenerate on every import, titles are what an admin types and
what a pack author knows. Two entries sharing a title share an overlay entry — surfaced by
`.lore show`, not resolved by guessing.

**One effective-state function.** `apply(entry, overlay)` is the ONLY place the effective
`enabled`/`condition` of an entry is computed, and all three activation paths consume it
(`core.worldbook.Worldbook.match`, its `_semantic_hits` half, and the `activewi` extra pass
in `inject_world_lore_prompt`). That is deliberate: the 2026-08-06 reversal of the
sole-active mechanism was partly because semantic recall bypassed the filter that keyword
matching honored. There is no second notion of "enabled" to bypass.

**No inference.** Nothing here reads a title for structure, groups entries into families or
suggests a choice — `docs/notes/rejected/sole-active-card-mechanism.md` is binding. An
overlay entry exists because an admin typed it or because a pack the admin installed
shipped it.

**Setup variables** ("set before play") ride the same document: an author marks a variable
`setup: true` (native lorecard) or an overlay file declares one for an imported tree path,
and the item stays PENDING until the table writes that path. Defaults do not count as
done — the whole point of the flag is that the author's default is not the table's choice.

Expressions are the CLOSED `core.condexpr` grammar, validated at write time; the full-EJS
JS fallback is never offered to a typed binding, so an overlay cannot smuggle code into the
sandbox. Evaluation stays fail-closed exactly as it is for a file's own condition.
