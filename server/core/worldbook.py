"""Worldbook lore entries and retrieval.

This module is intentionally self-contained for the M11 leaf pass: it owns the
entry model, persistence/indexing, keyword/vector matching, import
normalization, and the prompt section renderer.

Conditional injection (the EJS-compat pass): an entry may carry a `condition` —
a safe `core.condexpr` expression over the room's deterministic variables
(`core.varspace` unifies modvars + the imported MVU tree). At match time a
conditioned entry only fires when its expression is true; FAIL-CLOSED both ways
(a broken condition, or no resolver supplied, means "don't inject"). At
injection time entry content is rendered through `core.ejs_lite` (the EJS
subset + `{{getvar::}}`/`{{var:}}` macros) with NO setter — prompt assembly is
read-only and idempotent by design, so template `setvar(...)` statements are
deliberate no-ops there. SillyTavern imports map `@@if` decorators onto
`condition`, consume `[InitVar]`/`@@initial_variables` entries into the MVU
variable tree instead of storing them as lore, and disable render-time-only
entries (`[RENDER:*]` / `@@render_*` / `@@iframe` — frontend status-bar UI that
must never reach a prompt).

        ST trigger semantics ride on top of the base keyword/semantic selection: secondary-key
        logic and scan windows live in `_keyword_hit`; `probability` is rolled here with `rng`
        (real code randomness — pass a seeded `random.Random` in tests); inclusion groups pick
        ONE member per group by weight; `position` buckets order the final list. Timed effects
        (sticky/cooldown/delay) track against a per-room turn counter that ONLY advances when
        `advance_timers=True` — the once-per-turn injection path (the prompt builder) passes it;
        browse/search paths leave the counter and effect windows untouched.

        The room's M26 lore OVERLAY is applied before anything else, on BOTH selection halves
        (keyword and semantic), because effective "enabled" has exactly one definition —
        `core.lore_overlay.apply`. `overlay` is loaded here unless a caller already holds it.
