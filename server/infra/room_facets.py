"""Room-lifecycle facets (M23 WS1): the state's OWNER declares how it is disposed of.

Four operations end or replace a room's life — `.reset` (three scopes), room delete,
room import, room export. Before this module each of them carried its own
hand-enumerated list of what to clean, and the lists drifted: August 2026 alone fixed
three divergences (b23c450 reset vector orphans, 91b9ca4 an admin reset outside the
locked set, 9069575 a non-atomic restore), and the audit that opened M23 found a
fourth (import left the undo ring intact, so `.undo` could cross a `.save load`
boundary). The knowledge lived in the operations; it belongs with the state.

A `RoomStateFacet` is therefore declared BY the module that writes the state — the
chronicle facet beside the chronicle code, the character facet beside the character
manager, the turn-lock facet beside the hub that creates the locks. It names what the
family owns (document types, `room_state` keys and prefixes, vector collections,
whole room-scoped storages) and, in ONE place, when it dies.

## What this registry does and does not decide

It answers **what** to clean. It never answers **order** or **atomicity** — those stay
with the four operations in `net/room_backup.py`, where the segmented transactions and
their failure compensation live. A facet contributes targets to a segment the operation
chooses; it does not get to schedule itself.

## Reset scope

`reset_scope` is the LIGHTEST scope at which the facet dies, and the scopes nest
(`story` ⊂ `chars` ⊂ `all`). `reset_scope=None` means the facet survives every reset:
that is the room-SETTINGS family — language, house rules, enabled skills/presets/panels,
media toggles — configuration rather than campaign content. Surviving is a decision, so
`None` requires `survives_because` to say why; an unexplained survivor is the exact
drift this registry exists to prevent.

A facet may also own a SLICE of a family another facet owns wholesale: the companion half
of the `sheet` documents dies with the companion RECORDS at `story`, while the players'
sheets live on to `chars`. A slice is exactly what a target list cannot name, so such a
facet declares an `on_reset` hook and the operation runs it — the selection rule stays in
the module that wrote the state, and no lifecycle operation learns what a companion is.

## Export and import are one rule, not two

A facet names the room-scoped `storages` it lives in. Every storage a facet claims must
be carried by the export manifest — unless the facet sets `export_exempt_because`, in
which case the same reason obliges import to CLEAR that storage rather than restore it:
state that a snapshot does not carry must not survive the snapshot being loaded over the
room. That single rule is what makes the undo-ring bug structurally unrepeatable.
