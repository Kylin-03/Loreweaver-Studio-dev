# SVG mapmaker

Use `draw_svg_map` when a compact visual structure would help the table understand space,
routes, room hierarchy, or named locations. Good moments include:

- the party enters a new building, dungeon level, ship deck, town district, or investigation board
- players ask how rooms connect or which places are above/below/inside others
- a module has several named scenes and you need a player-safe overview
- you want a handout that shows only discovered or player-visible location names

Do not include keeper-only secrets, hidden rooms, trap truths, culprit identities, unrevealed clue
solutions, or private NPC motives. A map is a handout; everything drawn on it is player-visible.

Call `draw_svg_map` with:

- `title`: the map title
- `layout`: `"hierarchy"` for nested/flow structures, `"grid"` for rooms/floor-like layouts, or
  `"spatial"` when you can give rough north/east/size hints
- `areas_json`: a JSON list of area objects

Area objects may contain:

- `id`: short stable id, used by `parent` and `links`
- `name`: label shown on the map
- `parent`: id of the containing/previous area
- `description`: short player-visible subtitle
- `links`: list of ids connected to this area
- `pos`: for `layout:"spatial"`, a rough grid coordinate `[gx, gy]` where north is smaller `y`
  and east is larger `x` (0-11, floats allowed)
- `size`: for `layout:"spatial"`, a rough grid size `[w, h]` where important rooms can be larger

Example:

```json
[
  {"id":"manse","name":"Blackwood Manse","description":"front hall"},
  {"id":"library","name":"Library","parent":"manse","description":"locked cabinets"},
  {"id":"cellar","name":"Cellar","parent":"manse","description":"cold stone stairs"},
  {"id":"tunnel","name":"Old Tunnel","parent":"cellar","description":"bricked arch", "links":["garden"]}
]
```

Spatial example:

```json
[
  {"id":"stairs","name":"Cellar Stairs","description":"from kitchen","pos":[5,0],"size":[2,1]},
  {"id":"storage","name":"Storage Room","description":"barrels and sacks","pos":[2,3],"size":[3,2],"links":["stairs"]},
  {"id":"cistern","name":"Old Cistern","description":"echoing water","pos":[8,4],"size":[3,2],"links":["storage"]},
  {"id":"sealed","name":"Sealed Door","description":"iron-banded","pos":[8,7],"size":[2,1],"links":["cistern"]}
]
```

Use `layout:"spatial"` only for player-safe rough layouts. The coordinates are direction and
relative size hints, not exact architectural measurements.

After the tool sends the map, briefly orient the players to what is visible on it and continue the
scene. Do not narrate the SVG markup itself.
