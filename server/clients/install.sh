# It: (1) makes sure `bun` is on PATH (bun is both the runtime AND the package
# manager that auto-resolves the right @opentui/core native core per platform),
# (2) downloads the client tarball — GitHub Release by default, AUTO-FALLING-BACK to the
# 1a7432.site mirror if GitHub is unreachable, (3) moves the verified payload into
# $TRPG_HOME/clients and `bun install`s it THERE via the official npm registry by default
# (never in a staging directory — see the note above the commit step), (4) drops a
# `loreweaver` launcher. Nothing needs root.
#
# Force a source with TRPG_ORIGIN (e.g. TRPG_ORIGIN=https://1a7432.site/trpg to prefer the
# China mirror and skip the GitHub attempt). Pin or roll back a release with
# TRPG_RELEASE_TAG=release-... . Mirrors expose immutable assets under `releases/<tag>/`.

# are NTFS junctions, which can only store an ABSOLUTE target. Installing into a

# with "Cannot find module 'react/jsx-dev-runtime'" (issue #17). POSIX relative
# symlinks happened to survive the rename; the install location must not be a
# platform-dependent detail, so install where the launcher will run. Any failure
