//! The live-connect smoke gate: one test that dials a REAL `--serve` engine
//! through the real transport crate and asserts the handshake completes.
//!
//! Ignored by default — it needs an engine process — and driven by
//! `scripts/check_live_connect.sh`, which spawns the engine from the sibling
//! checkout and passes its ticket and keeper key through the environment:
//!
//! ```text
//! LOREWEAVER_LIVE_TICKET=endpoint…  LOREWEAVER_LIVE_KEY=…  \
//!   cargo test -p loreweaver-transport --test live_connect -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Why it exists: the transport used to refuse every welcome that did not
//! announce protocol major 1, and no test in either repo ever connected to a
//! real engine, so the refusal went unnoticed across a whole major bump. Unit
//! tests with a hand-written server cannot catch that class of bug — only a
//! real engine announcing its real version can.
