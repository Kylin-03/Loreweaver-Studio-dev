// "Test this pack now": the last hop of the author loop. A build+install used
// to dead-end — playing the thing you just built meant switching to Play,
// starting a server by hand, and retyping import commands with server-side
// paths. This module owns the ONE decision the loop needs: which commands take
// a freshly installed pack into a live room.
//
// Mirror of the engine's keeper surface (do not reinvent — read, then copy):
//   - `gateway/commands.py::cmd_import` — `.import <file> [system] [pc|companion|world]`;
//     `world` is keeper-only and is the entrance for module machinery.
//   - `gateway/commands.py::cmd_lore` — `.lore import <file>`.
//   - `core/pack.py::resolve_installed_path` — BOTH commands first try the ref
//     as `<packId>/<path relative to the installed pack dir>` against the newest
//     `data_dir/packs/<id>@<version>/`, falling back to a literal server path.
//     That is why the studio never has to know the install directory: it names
//     the pack and the in-pack path, exactly as `core/pack.py::install_pack`
//     laid them out (the manifest's own `cards/…` / `lorebooks/…` names).
//   - `core/pack.py::_parse_card_entry` — a BUILT manifest's `contents.cards`
//     entries carry `kind` (`character` | `world`), stamped from the real
//     payload at build time. That stamp, not anything the studio believes, is
//     what decides which cards get a world import.

 * `install-then-import` builds, installs and imports — the release-shaped path,
 * and the only one that proves the artifact a player will receive.
 *
 * `mount-source` is the engine's author dev room (`gateway/dev_room.py`,
 * landed 2026-08-15): the server mounts a pack SOURCE tree and follows it, so a
 * save reloads lore, skills, rulepacks and panels into the live room while the
 * room's variable values survive. It skips the build entirely, which is the
 * point AND the caveat — a dev mount serves panels and the kit straight from
 * source, past the build-time caps, so `--pack` remains the gate a release has
 * to pass. */
