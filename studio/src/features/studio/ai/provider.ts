// AI provider settings + the draft/validate/retry loop. Everything persists

// The key used to live in the OS credential store. That bought a real property
// — a compromised WebView could USE the key but never read it — at a price the
// app cannot pay: the `keyring` crate has no Android backend at all, and its
// Linux one needs a running Secret Service daemon, so the desktop-only path was
// a dead end for a Tauri app that means to ship on five platforms. On macOS it
// also re-prompted after every rebuild with a modal that could hang a draft for
// eighteen minutes. One path that works everywhere beats a stronger one that
// works in two places. The key is a local secret in a local app; treat this
// file's storage as no more private than the rest of the session.
