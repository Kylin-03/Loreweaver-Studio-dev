// The advisory pack lint: rules over a pack's authored content.
//
// Why it exists: the engine CLI already refuses packs that cannot BUILD. What
// nothing catches is the pack that builds perfectly and then does nothing —
// a lore entry with no trigger, a variable nobody reads, and above all a panel
// bound to a keeper-only variable, which renders blank for every player while
// looking right to the author (who is the keeper). That last one is the trap
// the exposure model creates, and it is the reason this file exists.
//
// Every finding is advisory. Nothing here blocks a build; the engine stays the
// authority, and the author outranks the lint.
