// The card-split (拆卡) workbench's session, persisted.
//
// This used to be a `useState` in `SplitView.tsx`, which meant a tab switch or a
// reload silently destroyed the work: prose edits on the character half, every
// promotion decision, the AI-filled labels. Nothing warned, nothing came back.
//
// What survives a reload, and what cannot:
//   - Everything the author TYPED or DECIDED is persisted verbatim.
//   - The dropped file's BYTES are not. A JSON card is text, so it is stored as
//     text and the bytes are rebuilt exactly on restore. A PNG card is not, so
//     the session comes back marked "re-attach needed": every edit is still
//     there, but the one action that needs the original bytes (handing the card
//     to the pack bench, which ships the file as-is) asks for the file again
//     rather than shipping something subtly different.
// The file's name, size and sha256 ride along either way, so a re-attach can be
// checked against what was originally opened.
