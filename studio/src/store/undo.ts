// Snapshot undo for deletes.
//
// The studio had no undo at all — only two "this cannot be undone" strings,
// which is a warning, not a safety net. This is the smallest thing that is
// genuinely one: every delete pushes a closure that puts the thing back, and a
// toast offers it for a few seconds.
//
// Deliberately NOT an editor undo stack. It covers deletions only, it does not
// coalesce or replay keystrokes, and it is in-memory: a closure cannot be
// serialized, and an undo that survives a reload would promise more than a
// snapshot can honestly deliver (the thing it restores may have been rebuilt in
// the meantime). Losing the offer on reload is the safe failure.
