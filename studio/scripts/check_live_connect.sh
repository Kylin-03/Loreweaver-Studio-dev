# Live-connect smoke gate (studio ↔ engine), the half no fixture can cover:
# spawn a REAL `python -m app --serve` engine from the sibling checkout, dial it
# through the REAL Rust transport crate, and assert the join handshake completes
# with a `welcome` on the event channel.
#
# Why it exists: the transport used to close the connection on any welcome that
# did not announce protocol major 1. The engine had been on 2.x for weeks and
# nothing caught it, because no test in either repo ever connected to a real
# server — the loopback tests write their own welcome, so they agreed with
# whatever the client believed. This gate fails if the Rust layer ever again
# refuses a welcome the frontend (`src/store/connection.ts`) would accept.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/check_live_connect.sh   (also stage 5 of check_roundtrip.sh)
# Engine repo: $TRPG_KP_REPO, default ../trpg_kp (sibling checkout).
#
# The engine runs sandboxed: its own keystore, data dir and env file under a
# temp directory, so nothing touches the operator's campaign data, and with no
# LLM configured it falls back to the offline demo Keeper (no external calls).
# The sandbox covers the env file, and the env file is only half the story —
# pydantic-settings reads real environment variables at HIGHER priority than the
# file, so an exported `TRPG_DATA_DIR` or `TRPG_LLM__API_KEY` in the operator's
# shell would walk straight past it. Every `TRPG_*` is scrubbed before spawning.
