# Loreweaver Studio

The desktop client for [Loreweaver](https://github.com/1A7432/loreweaver) — the self-hosted AI
gamemaster engine — and its card-authoring studio. **This is the recommended way to play**; the
engine's terminal client is the one-line-install alternative for anywhere with a terminal. Built
with Tauri 2 (Rust core + TypeScript/React UI), targeting desktop (macOS / Windows / Linux) and,
later, mobile (iOS / Android). It speaks the engine's open wire protocol (2.3) and nothing else,
so it runs against any Loreweaver server — the one it can start for you with one click, or a
friend's, or a VPS.

> Formats and internals still move; the protocol's major version is the compatibility contract.

## Install

Grab an installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/1A7432/loreweaver-studio/releases/latest):

- **macOS** — `.dmg` (separate Apple-silicon and Intel builds). The builds are not
  yet notarized, so the first launch needs one extra step: right-click the app →
  **Open** (or `xattr -cr "/Applications/Loreweaver Studio.app"` once).
- **Windows** — the NSIS `-setup.exe`. Unsigned for now: if SmartScreen interjects,
  choose **More info → Run anyway**.
- **Linux** — `.AppImage` (`chmod +x` and run) or `.deb`.

Or build from source with Rust stable and [Bun](https://bun.sh):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/1A7432/loreweaver-studio && cd loreweaver-studio
bun install
bun tauri build          # a .app / bundle for your platform
bun tauri dev            # or run it unbundled, with hot reload
```

Then open the app, and on the connect screen either paste the **ticket** and **invite key** your
Keeper sent you, or click **Host locally & play**: it fetches a prebuilt engine server for your OS
(SHA-256 verified), starts it, and signs you in as the Keeper. No Python, no environment setup.

Two modes, one app:

- **Play** (default): the full table — markdown narrative log with colour-coded dice, live
  character / party / variables panels (the keeper view shows unexposed variables dimmed and
  locked), presence and AI-keeper turn status, a module's own panels — tier-1 template blocks
  _and_ tier-2 rich pages, each in a locked-down sandboxed frame with no network — and the
  keeper screens: rooms & invites, model, module, rules, KP skills, character creation, room
  lifecycle (reset / save / undo), audio deck and media.
- **Studio**: a local-first card forge with three benches:
  - **Forge** — typed module variables, worldbook entries, and hooks, exported as a
    native Loreweaver bundle or a SillyTavern-compatible card;
  - **Card split (拆卡)** — open any ST card (JSON/PNG) and see it decomposed the way
    the engine imports it: character half | world half, with the MVU `[InitVar]` tree
    promoted to typed, validated variables (author confirms every row) and suggested
    `.var expose` lines generated for the pack notes;
  - **Pack** — drop cards/lorebooks/assets, get an installable `.lwpack`: deterministic
    classification and splitting, AI-drafted (human-confirmed) bilingual metadata, a
    generated source tree, then the ENGINE CLI builds and optionally installs it — the
    studio contains no zip writer on purpose; validation has one source of truth.
  - **AI drafting** throughout is gated by deterministic code: every model output goes
    through the same schema validation as hand-typed content or it never lands. Bring
    your own provider (OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic); the key is stored locally with
    the rest of your settings, and requests leave from the Rust side, never the WebView.

## Architecture

- **Transport** lives in the Rust core (`crates/transport`): an [iroh](https://iroh.computer)
  QUIC connection speaking the newline-delimited JSON protocol (ALPN `loreweaver/tui/1`)
  defined by the main repo's
  [docs/protocol.md](https://github.com/1A7432/loreweaver/blob/main/docs/protocol.md).
  The WebView never does networking; it consumes typed frames over the Tauri event bridge.
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite, `zustand` state, `i18next` (en/zh from day one).
- **Shared frame types** come from
  [`@loreweaver/protocol`](https://github.com/1A7432/loreweaver/tree/main/clients/protocol),
  consumed as the published `loreweaver-protocol` npm package.

## Status

- **Play mode**: complete against protocol 2.3 — narrative / dice / state / presence / turn
  status, tier-1 and tier-2 module panels, the keeper screens, one-click local host, audio and
  media. Tier-1 panel instantiation is the reference client's resolver, ported rule for
  rule and pinned by the shared vector table
  (`src/features/play/panels/fixtures/panel_template_vectors.json`) that
  the engine and the reference client run too.
- **Desktop (macOS)**: verified — release build + `.app` bundle succeed (`bun tauri build`;
  the final DMG script needs a GUI session).
- **Windows / Linux**: CI compiles and tests the full workspace on Linux; no bundles built yet.
  **Release bundles for all three desktops are the next milestone** — until then, install from
  source (above).
- **iOS**: `src-tauri/gen/apple` is generated (Tauri 2 + CocoaPods). Compiling for the
  `aarch64-apple-ios` target currently requires accepting the Xcode license
  (`sudo xcodebuild -license accept`) on this machine; signing needs a development team.
- **Android**: blocked on local tooling — the SDK lacks `cmdline-tools` and an NDK
  (`sdkmanager "ndk;…"`); `tauri android init` bails until they exist.
- **Card forge**: local authoring + dual export (JSON and PNG-embedded, each naming
  the flavor it writes), native-bundle import, card splitting, MVU→VarSpec promotion,
  AI drafting, an advisory pack lint, and the pack pipeline — build, install, and
  "test now" straight into a live local table ([formats](docs/FORMATS.md)).
- **Serialized modules**: one pack, cumulative versions. The release at episode N
  carries episodes 1..N and nothing of N+1, so the file that circulates is
  spoiler-safe by construction rather than by gating.
- Protocol feedback for upstream lives in [PROTOCOL_NOTES.md](PROTOCOL_NOTES.md);
  engine/tooling asks from the forge work live in [UPSTREAM_TODO.md](UPSTREAM_TODO.md).

## Development

Prerequisites: Rust stable and [Bun](https://bun.sh):

```sh
bun install
bun tauri dev
```

Checks (all run in CI):

```sh
bun run lint && bun run format:check && bun run typecheck && bun run test && bun run build
cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace
```

### Cross-repo round-trip gate

`bun run roundtrip` (`scripts/check_roundtrip.sh`) fails when the studio's real
output and the engine's real parsers drift apart. It pins four things:

- **lorecard v1 byte drift** — the real `exportNativeBundle` output, regenerated
  on the spot, must stay byte-identical to the engine's pinned
  `tests/fixtures/studio_export.lorecard.json`;
- **pack manifest v2 full-tree build** — a full-surface module pack is laid out
  by the real `buildPackSourcePlan` (`scripts/gen_roundtrip_pack.ts`) and must
  build clean through the engine's `python -m app --pack --json`, with the
  expected detection results in the returned `trust` object. It carries every
  shape a pack can hold a card in — a world lorecard (native), a clean ST
  character card, an ST-flavored WORLD card (hooks + `[InitVar]` + an EJS span,
  so engine-side world detection is exercised on the SillyTavern path too), and
  a PNG-embedded card — plus a skill, a rulepack patch, a stage-E rules-script
  rulepack, a lorebook, tier-1/2 panels, a presentation kit, assets, and a
  prep-phase plan script, and a keeper prompt preset;
- **the engine's conformance suites** for the pinned fixtures
  (`test_studio_export_fixture`, `test_lorecard`, `test_visible_when_vectors`,
  `test_panel_template_vectors`), and the two vector tables this repo vendors must be
  byte-identical to the engine's;
- **the live-connect smoke gate** (`scripts/check_live_connect.sh`) — the three
  above are all static formats, so they cannot notice that the two _processes_
  stopped talking. This stage spawns a real `python -m app --serve` engine in a
  sandboxed data dir and dials it through the real Rust transport crate
  (`crates/transport/tests/live_connect.rs`, `#[ignore]`d for a normal
  `cargo test`), asserting the join handshake ends in a `welcome`. Skip it with
  `LIVE_CONNECT=0` on a machine without cargo.

It needs a checkout of the engine repo (default `../trpg_kp`, override with
`TRPG_KP_REPO`) with `uv` available, and the engine's optional `ejs` extra —
the fixture's rules-script rulepack compiles through QuickJS at pack-build time:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/1A7432/loreweaver.git ../trpg_kp   # once
(cd ../trpg_kp && uv sync --extra ejs)                          # once
bun run roundtrip
```

Generated trees land in the gitignored `target/roundtrip/` for inspection.
